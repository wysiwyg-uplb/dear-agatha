      &emsp;I just want you to know that I really appreciate your existence and this is a gift of appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;Para rin sa'yo 'yang playlist na nasa itaas. If you ever want to feel loved or appreciated, you can listen to it anytime.
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;I am truly grateful that there was once a time in my life that I had the chance to meet someone like you and I also treasure every second na I am with you. 
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;Agatha, the only thing that I really want is for you to always know na nandito lang ako, as anyone that you need, anytime. 
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;If ever man na talikuran ka ng mundo, 'wag mong kalilimutan na mayroon pa ring mga haharap sa'yo. You have your friends, your family, you still have me.
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;I really like what we have now, hindi ko na muna ipipilit 'yong sarili ko sa buhay mo but who knows what tomorrow holds for us?
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;Agatha, marami pa tayong pagdaraanan. I don't mean literally 'tayo' HAHAHA. Kaya natin 'to, walang sukuan sa buhay. Kung napapagod, magpahinga lang. 
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;Marami pa akong gustong sabihin na wala rito sa letter and I am telling it to you little by little naman. Kapag hindi mo na nga lang ako kinausap, hindi mo na malalaman 'yon hays, ikaw din. :P
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;By the way, have I ever told you, I really like your name and how it fits your beauty. Bagay na bagay sa'yo ang palaging nakangiti. 
    </p>
